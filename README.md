# Module-5-Work-Day-Scheduler

A workday planner that is color-coded depending on the hour, and saves written inputs. Utilizes Moment.js to keep track of the date and hour, and Bootstrap, jQuery, and HTML for the functionality and look of the deployed site.

The deployed site can be found [here](https://hklotz13.github.io/Module-5-Work-Day-Scheduler/).

Known issues: color coding is not being applied, and text is disappearing upon refresh
